# mail_receipts
This Python script accesses my Gmail account and my Google Docs Receipts document, using Google APIs,
taking my receipt emails, add their details as line items in my receipts doc, and trash the emails.

OBSOLETE (well, maybe). I've rewrittent this into a Google Apps Script that's uber convenient as an add-on
to the Gmail UI. See my [MailReceipts](https://github.com/dimichelec/MailReceipts) repo for that.
